This repository contains a collection of **Jupyter notebooks** developed as part of the Data Engineering & Machine Learning module. The aim is to provide foundational knowledge in information and data engineering, along with key machine learning concepts. Python is the main programming language used to enhance both mathematical and coding skills, while exploring advanced topics like modern machine learning platforms, data visualization, and deep learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Main Topics

The following aspects of machine learning are covered:

1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Introduction to fundamental techniques like Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, using libraries like *Scikit-learn*.

2. **Data Processing and Visualization**: Applying techniques for data pre-processing, post-processing, and visualization using libraries like *NumPy*, *Pandas*, and *Matplotlib*.

3. **Practical Applications**: Using real-world datasets to identify trends, make inferences, and implement solutions for tasks such as image classification.

## ðŸ“˜ Activities

### 1. Linear Algebra & Python

The purpose of this activity is to become confident with *matrix addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *determining matrix determinants*, *inverse*, *cross-product* and *eigenvalues*, developing code for these operations and creating Python functions to represent this functionality in a reusable way.

The first Jupyter Notebook could be found here: [Activity 1](https://github.com/Arianna6400/DE-ML/blob/master/Activity1/Etivity1_LinearAlgebra.ipynb).

### 2. Probability & Python

This activity focuses on the application of *probability theory*, utilizing Python's *Random* module to simulate random events and generate datasets. Statistical properties of these datasets are calculated and compared to theoretical estimates to assess the alignment between simulated and expected outcomes. Additionally, data distributions are visualized to gain deeper insights into the stochastic nature of the generated datasets.

This exploration is essential for understanding the probabilistic foundations of real-world machine learning problems, where data and algorithms often exhibit stochastic behavior.

The activity also extends Python programming skills by introducing topics such as reading CSV files and object-oriented programming through the use of classes. Furthermore, it serves as an introduction to **Reinforcement Learning**, complementing previous knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning, thus broadening the understanding of different learning paradigms in machine learning. 

The second Jupyter Notebook could be found here: [Activity 2](https://github.com/Arianna6400/DE-ML/blob/master/Activity2/Etivity2_Probability.ipynb).
